/* How to reuse logic between different flutter components?
*
* Rather unfortunately, the official flutter docs don't really have much to say on this
* (as far as I could find). Luckily, flutter is a reactive paradigm, and React does
* have some things to say about this.
*
* With functional components in React, you could just extract the logic into
* custom hooks, but hooks aren't a thing in flutter.
*
* Edit: hooks are actually a thing in flutter!
*
* People coming from a non-declarative paradigm would be forgiven for the next
* most natural thing that comes to mind, i.e. inheritance. But why is this
* not such a good idea? Take a look at the following:

class A extends StatelessWidget {
  const A({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  void _signUp() {

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {

      child: Text('Sign Up'),
      onPressed: _signUp,
    );
  }
}

class B extends A {
  const B({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return IconButton(
      icon: Icon(Icons.star),
      onPressed: _signUp,
    );
  }
}

/* The sign up method is shared between A and B.
* This is not bad, but it's not really true that B is an extension of A, it's just
* a different type of A. However, how would you share logic between stateless and stateful
* components?
*
* And the problem becomes even more complicated when the widgets are stateful:
* */

class C extends StatefulWidget {
  const C({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  _CState createState() => _CState();

/* Now, because the logic is in the state class, it's the state classes that inherit.
* This will compile, BUT you would not be able to access fields in the stateful widget
* like you normally do, because D state extends C state, which itself extends State<C>!!
*
* Clearly we need a better way of sharing logic between components than inheritance.
* As stated at https://reactjs.org/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html,
* we should really be using composition rather than inheritance to reuse code.
*
* Option 1: mixins. Edit: Mixins are actually not great, because they don't allow

/* Pretty cool, pretty cool. In this way, the sign up logic can be reused anywhere

* From https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html
*
* I have to say, this one is a new and rather alien concept to me. I don't think it's
